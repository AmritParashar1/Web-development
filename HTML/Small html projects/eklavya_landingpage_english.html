        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to <strong>EKLAVYA CLASSES</strong>, a platform dedicated to transforming lives through education. We believe that every child deserves the chance to learn and grow, regardless of their circumstances. Our mission is to connect underprivileged students with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) committed to educational support.
        </p>
        <P>
            We understand the power of education in breaking the cycle of poverty and enabling individuals to lead a dignified life. Our platform serves as a bridge, linking students in need with NGOs that can provide them with the resources and support they require to continue their studies.
        </P>
        <p>
            Through our efforts, we aim to create a society where every child has access to quality education, and the opportunity to realize their full potential. Join us in our mission to make education accessible for all, because at <strong>EKLAVYA CLASSES</strong>, we believe that a child's future should never be defined by their present circumstances.
